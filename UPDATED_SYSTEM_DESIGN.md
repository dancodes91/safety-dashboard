## CSV Import Implementation Details

### KPA Events Import

**Supported File Formats**: CSV, Excel (.xlsx, .xls)

**Expected Column Structure**:
```
Report #, Link, Observer, Employee:, Division:, Home Plant:,
Employee: - Hire Date, Employee: - Hire Duration, Employee: - Supervisor,
Is this an Accident, Incident, Near Miss?, Unit #:, Holliday Equipment Type:,
Job#, Date & Time of Accident/Incident:, Place of Accident/Incident:,
Plant:, Attach Video, Description of Event:, Any Injuries Involved?,
Please Select One:, Choose type of event
```

**Data Transformation**:
- Maps CSV columns to database schema
- Converts date strings to Date objects
- Handles boolean conversion for injury status
- Validates required fields before insertion
- Updates existing records or creates new ones based on Report #

### Samsara Driver Records Import

**Supported File Formats**: CSV, Excel (.xlsx, .xls)

**Expected Column Structure**:
```
Rank, Driver Name, Driver Tags, Tag Paths, Driver ID, Username,
Safety Score, Drive Time (hh:mm:ss), Total Distance (mi), Total Events,
Total Behaviors, [Speeding Data Columns], [Event Data Columns]
```

**Data Transformation**:
- Processes nested speeding data structure
- Handles complex event tracking metrics
- Converts time formats and numeric values
- Updates existing records or creates new ones based on Driver ID

   - Yellow: 2-4 incidents per month
   - Red: > 4 incidents per month

2. **Driver Safety Score**
   - Target: > 95 average safety score
   - Yellow: 90-95 average safety score
   - Red: < 90 average safety score

3. **Preventable Incidents**
   - Target: < 30% of total incidents
   - Yellow: 30-50% preventable
   - Red: > 50% preventable

4. **Training Compliance**
   - Target: > 95% completion rate
   - Yellow: 85-95% completion rate
   - Red: < 85% completion rate

## Weekly Reporting System

### Automated Report Generation
The system generates weekly safety reports that include:

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Total incidents for the week
   - Comparison with previous week
   - Key performance indicators status

2. **Incident Analysis**
   - Breakdown by type, division, and preventability
   - Top incident locations

## Implementation Workflow

### 1. Data Import Process
```
User uploads CSV file → File validation → Data parsing → 
Schema mapping → Database insertion → Success/Error reporting
```

### 2. Dashboard Update Process
```
Database change → Real-time data fetch → KPI calculation → 
Chart generation → UI update → Color coding application
```

### 3. Report Generation Process
```
Scheduled trigger → Data aggregation → KPI analysis → 
Template population → Email generation → Distribution
```

## Security and Compliance

### Data Protection
- All file uploads are validated for format and content
- User authentication required for all import operations
- Audit logging for all data modifications
- Secure file handling with automatic cleanup

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions for different user types
- Admin-only access to import functionality
- Read-only access for standard users
- Supervisor access for their division data

## Performance Optimization

### Database Indexing
```javascript
// KPA Events indexes
db.kpaevents.createIndex({ "reportNumber": 1 })
db.kpaevents.createIndex({ "dateTime": -1 })
db.kpaevents.createIndex({ "division": 1, "plant": 1 })
db.kpaevents.createIndex({ "eventCategory": 1 })

// Driver Records indexes
db.samsaradriverrecords.createIndex({ "driverId": 1 })
db.samsaradriverrecords.createIndex({ "safetyScore": -1 })
db.samsaradriverrecords.createIndex({ "weekStartDate": -1 })
```

### Caching Strategy
