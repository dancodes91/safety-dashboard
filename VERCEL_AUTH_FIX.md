# NextAuth Authentication Fix for Vercel Deployment

## Problem
NextAuth Credentials provider login works locally but fails on Vercel deployment, redirecting back to signin page instead of completing authentication.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing NEXTAUTH_URL environment variable on Vercel**
2. **Incorrect NEXTAUTH_URL configuration**
3. **Potential database connection issues**
4. **Missing error logging for debugging**

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Logging
- Added comprehensive console logging to the NextAuth authorize function
- Added logging to signIn and redirect callbacks
- Enabled debug mode for development environment

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Added detailed error logging for database connection issues
- Added step-by-step authentication flow logging
- Enhanced redirect callback to handle different URL scenarios

## Required Actions on Vercel

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
3. Add/Update the following variables:

```
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=akduqjWHGDEX+GoOf9Gz8g3KzyDE4R4Pb4cOwivdROA=
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-deployed-domain.vercel.app
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://newssstrike:Ravz1VmsMEifqS9C@cluster0.pil1nia.mongodb.net/safety-dashboard?retryWrites=true&w=majority
DEMO_USER_EMAIL=admin@example.com
DEMO_USER_PASSWORD=password123
```

**IMPORTANT**: Replace `https://your-deployed-domain.vercel.app` with your actual Vercel deployment URL.

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables

Make sure all environment variables are set for the "Production" environment in Vercel.

### Step 3: Redeploy

After setting the environment variables, trigger a new deployment by:
- Pushing a new commit to your repository, OR
- Going to Deployments tab and clicking "Redeploy" on the latest deployment

## Testing Steps

### 1. Check Logs
After deployment, check the Vercel function logs:
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Click on "Functions" tab
3. Look for logs from the NextAuth API route
4. Check for the console.log messages we added

### 2. Test Authentication
1. Visit your deployed site
2. Try to login with demo credentials:
   - Email: `admin@example.com`
   - Password: `password123`
3. Check browser developer tools for any console errors
4. Check Vercel function logs for authentication flow logs

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: NEXTAUTH_URL Mismatch
**Symptom**: Authentication fails silently
**Solution**: Ensure NEXTAUTH_URL exactly matches your deployed domain (including https://)

### Issue 2: Database Connection Timeout
**Symptom**: Authentication hangs or fails with database errors
**Solution**: 
- Verify MongoDB connection string is correct
- Check if MongoDB Atlas allows connections from Vercel IPs (0.0.0.0/0)
- Consider increasing connection timeout in mongoose configuration

### Issue 3: NEXTAUTH_SECRET Missing
**Symptom**: JWT errors or session issues
**Solution**: Ensure NEXTAUTH_SECRET is set in Vercel environment variables

### Issue 4: Middleware Conflicts
**Symptom**: Infinite redirect loops
**Solution**: The middleware.ts has been configured to allow auth routes, but verify it's working correctly

## Debugging Commands

If issues persist, you can add temporary debugging by checking the Vercel function logs for these messages:

1. `NextAuth authorize called with:` - Shows if the authorize function is being called
2. `Demo user authentication successful` - Shows if demo login is working
3. `SignIn callback called:` - Shows if the signIn callback is executed
4. `Redirect callback called:` - Shows redirect URL handling

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Use Demo Credentials First**: Test with the demo credentials before trying database authentication
2. **Check Network Tab**: Use browser dev tools to monitor API calls to `/api/auth/*`
3. **Verify CORS**: Ensure your domain is properly configured for CORS if needed
4. **Database Whitelist**: Make sure your MongoDB Atlas cluster allows connections from Vercel

## Next Steps After Fix

Once authentication is working:
1. Remove debug logging from production
2. Set up proper user management
3. Consider implementing additional security measures
4. Test all protected routes

## Support

If the issue persists after following these steps:
1. Check Vercel function logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are correctly set
3. Test the demo credentials first before database authentication
4. Check if the MongoDB connection is working from Vercel
